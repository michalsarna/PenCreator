# Versions

Each release gets the next version number. Newest first.

## v0.8.5

* **Recording tab:** a new tab of the side panel with a panel for each camera of the device, named after the camera: **Take a photo**, **Record video**, the **Time-lapse**, the **Video format**, the **Folder** and the way its **Camera view** opens. Each camera records on its own, with its own settings kept with it; a camera that records and is not shown reads its own picture. With more than one camera the names of the files have the camera in them. The camera view keeps only the buttons: a photo, a video, the time-lapse started and stopped.
* **Time-lapse photos with the pen moved aside** (on the Recording tab): during a job a picture that is due waits for the next move with the pen up; the head goes to a place you set (machine coordinates, **Use the current position**), waits a moment, takes a new picture, comes back and the job goes on.
* **After every lift:** a new way of the time-lapse, a picture every time the pen goes up, with the head moved aside. The drawing takes much longer.
* **HPGL:** the HPGL page of the device settings has **Way aside for photos**, the plotter's own commands for the trip (for example `PA0,8000;`).
* **Split long lines** (on the Recording tab): long straight lines are sent as 2 to 256 shorter ones, each at least a set length, so a job can stop sooner and its progress moves more evenly. The path stays the same.
* **Help:** the wiki describes the Recording tab, the photos aside and the split lines.

## v0.8.4

* **Style trace:** **Arrange → Style trace…** (also in the right-click menu of a picture and in **Properties**) draws a picture again as lines in one of 19 styles: squiggle, sawtooth, springs, spiral, waves, halftone circles, etching, squares, needles, Truchet tiles, contour lines, Hilbert curve, stippling, one continuous line (TSP), triangles and cells, line art, flow lines, sketch and scribble. A live preview, the settings of each style, tone (black and white point, gamma), a random pattern for the random styles, and the layer the lines go on. The lines go on the first empty layer that draws outlines; every dot of stippling is drawn. A layer that already holds shapes keeps how it works.
* **Help:** a new wiki page **Style Trace** (**Obrysuj w stylu**).

## v0.8.3

* **Drag knife:** a plotter can cut (vinyl, paper, card, stencils) in place of drawing: on the **Pen** page of the device tick **The tool is a drag knife**. The offset of the tip is made good at every corner (the blade turns round a sharp corner on the spot), the holes are cut before the parts round them and a closed outline is cut on past its start, so it closes; **The cutter makes good the offset itself** for vinyl cutters that do it in their controller. The preview shows the path of the axis and what the tip cuts.
* **Knife library:** **Plotter → Knife library…** has ready-made knives (the 30°, 45° and 60° blades and a drag knife in a holder of a CNC machine) and your own: **Copy** makes one with a name, the offset of the tip, the corners, the overcut and notes. A device picks its knife from a list; the library is kept with the settings and in the backup.
* **HPGL commands of a device:** a device with an HPGL plotter or cutter has an **HPGL** page, only such devices have it: what is sent at the start and at the end, pen or knife down and up, the speed (with a top limit, or never) and the force of the knife (or never). **Back to the usual commands** puts the defaults back.
* **Help:** a new wiki page **Drag Knife** (**Nóż wleczony**), and the README and the wiki list the machines PenCreator has been tested on (a pen plotter built after the Drawing Robot, Arduino UNO, CNC Shield, GRBL).

## v0.8.2

* **G-code in the units of the machine:** a device set to inches gets **G20** and every length and feed in inches; a device in millimetres **G21** and millimetres. Before, every program was written in millimetres whatever the device said: check the units of your devices before the first job.
* **Units of the program:** **Settings → Program options… → Units** shows lengths in millimetres, centimetres, metres, inches or feet, or as the device. They are used by the sizes in **Properties**, the ruler, the **Dimensions** and the preview. The device window offers millimetres or inches, the units of the controller.
* **Both units** when the program and the machine count in different systems: the dimensions and the ruler show **25.4 mm [1.000"]**.
* **Texts and help:** other programs are named only where their files are read or written.

## v0.8.1

* **Dimensions:** a button next to **Toolpaths** shows the drawing as on a technical drawing: the width and height of the whole and of every outline (the outside and the holes), and the diameters of the round ones, the same ones named once (**4 × Ø 6**). The preview has a **Dimensions** button too.
* **Ruler (M):** a new tool. Drag or click two points for the length, ΔX, ΔY and the angle. It snaps to nodes, to the middles of segments and to the centres of circles and ellipses. A click on a straight segment gives its length; on a circle its radius and diameter; on an ellipse both radii; on a curve its length, and for an arc of a circle the radius drawn from its centre.
* **Right click with a tool** is a double Escape: back to selecting. In node edit a right click on a node or a segment opens the menu of the node bar.
* **Node bar:** the keys are in the names (**Break (B)**); **Smooth** has the key **G**; the radius stands after **Round (R)**; **Open / close** is gone (Break opens, dropping an end on the other closes).
* **Shift** draws a circle with the ellipse tool and a square with the rectangle, also while the shape is being drawn.
* **Several objects selected:** each one has a thin dashed frame of its own.
* **Objects of a layer that is not made** are faded clearly towards the work area.
* **The preview:** its options are buttons, light blue while they are on.
* **A drag that went on after the button was let go** (an object, a slider or a colour following the pointer) is ended.
* **TIFF pictures** (`.tif`, `.tiff`) are read like the other pictures.
* **Device window:** **Connection** is the second page, after **General**.

## v0.8.0

* **Files of LightBurn and MillMage, both ways:** checked against the same drawings saved by LightBurn 2.2 and MillMage 0.9.
  * **Import:** MillMage projects (`.mage`, **File → Import → Import LightBurn / MillMage project…**, the file window and drag and drop), the Illustrator files of the old PostScript kind that LightBurn writes, and the pictures inside an SVG (on the active layer). DXF of both kinds (current and R12, *legacy*) and LightBurn projects were read already.
  * **Export:** **File → Export → Export DXF…** (the current kind, as LightBurn writes it), **Export DXF R12 (legacy)…**, **Export Adobe Illustrator…**, **Export LightBurn project…** (`.lbrn2`, or `.lbrn` when you name the file so) and **Export MillMage project…**. **Export SVG…** keeps the pictures now. Pictures go into SVG, LightBurn and MillMage files; DXF and Illustrator have no room for them.
  * A LightBurn path closed by a curve into its first point came in slightly flattened there; fixed.
* **Auto levels** in the image import window changed nothing on a real photo (it has a black and a white pixel somewhere). Now the outer 0.5 % of the pixels on each side are left out, and while it is on the two sliders of **Levels** are locked and show the range found in the picture.
* **LinuxCNC (file):** a controller for machines run by LinuxCNC: no connection, **Start** saves the G-code file.
* **Pen lifted by G-code of your own:** separate lines for up and down (for example `M3 S1000` / `M5` for a solenoid, `M280 P0 S…` for a servo on Marlin). Plotters with a language of their own (AxiDraw / EggBot, HPGL) do not offer it. Not tried on a real machine yet: try the first job with no paper.
* **Preview:** **Paper colour** in the bar of the preview (white until you choose one).

## v0.7.0

* **AxiDraw / EggBot and HPGL plotters:** the Connection page offers them after the GRBL versions. The program's G-code is turned into the plotter's own commands, so Start, the progress, the stop at a pen change, Pause and Stop work. Not tried on real plotters yet: try the first job with the pen raised and no paper.
* **Adding a device:** one window with the basic settings, as in LightCreator: the controller (the GRBL versions or a plotter), the connection with **Read from device**, the work area, the machine zero and how the pen is lifted, an optional camera, **Worth checking**, and **More settings…** for the whole device window.
* **Camera view as in LightCreator:** a separate window, a tab of the side panel or a tab of the work area, chosen in the view and kept for each camera; the picture zooms with the wheel or the zoom bar, moves and fits; the window keeps its place.
* **Paste a picture:** Ctrl/Cmd+V or **Edit → Paste** with a picture in the clipboard (a screenshot, a picture copied in a browser) opens the image import window with it. Shapes copied in the program are still pasted as shapes, unless a picture was copied after them. On Windows and Linux Ctrl+V over the drawing pastes the copied shapes again.
* **Image import window:** it keeps its size (in Polish it grew to the width of the screen), and the picture zooms and moves as in the trace window.
* **One zoom bar for every picture:** zoom in, zoom out and the whole picture, with the zoom, in the lower left corner of the preview, the trace and import windows, the G-code viewer and the camera view; in the preview it also fits all the objects (the fit icons left its title line).
* **Node editing:** keys D delete, I insert a node, L line, S curve, C corner, R round, B break the path at the node (also a new **Break** button); a node dropped onto another one joins them (the ends of a path close it, neighbours merge, the ends of two paths make one).
* **Properties:** arrows of their direction before W and H. **Font list:** the arrows go through the open list and change the font; ten fonts are seen.
* **Secondary grid:** drawn only at a zoom of more than 200 %.
* **Windows of their own** (a tab taken out, the camera) have the bar of the main window and square corners.
* **grblHAL and FluidNC:** the start-up line of grblHAL is known (no wait after connecting), its build info is read whole, and the Control tab shows **Not homed** and the tool in the spindle.

## v0.6.2

* **Copy and paste with other programs:** a text field takes what you paste from another program, and **Copy** on a message reaches other programs. The builds had no access to the clipboard of the system, so this worked only inside the program.
* **The address of a camera:** new lines and spaces around a pasted address are cut, and the settings of a device cannot be saved while a camera has no address.

## v0.6.1

* **USB keyboards and pads:** **Machine → Control devices** connects a keyboard and any number of pads, each with its own keys for the moves, Stop, Pause, Home and the pen up and down. A machine can have its own device; otherwise it uses the default one. The devices are common to LightCreator, MillCreator and PenCreator and are kept in the backup. Only the window in front takes the presses, and a move lasts while the key is held.
* **New colour schemes:** Superman, Batman, and Joker in a dark and a light version.
* No more compiler warnings when building.
* **Cameras:** the camera of the computer now works in the released programs (it was left out of the builds, so it said this version cannot use it); macOS asks for the permission.
* **The page of the cameras** is the same as in LightCreator: the test of a camera, the picture settings and the lens correction are new.
* **Messages can be copied:** select the text of a message or the status line with the mouse, or use **Copy** on the right button.
* **macOS:** when the system blocks a controller or a camera on the local network, the message says where to allow the program (*Privacy & Security → Local Network*).
* **Edit → Copy and Paste** of the menu work in a text field; they copied and pasted shapes of the drawing.

## v0.6.0

* **One quick guide:** the sections on the window, drawing, import, the gallery, the machine and the keys are the same in every program (F1). It now also covers editing nodes, rounding corners, locking and the gallery.
* **Backup:** the zip now holds your layer presets. Restoring puts them in place of the current list; an older backup without them leaves the list alone.
* **Start** is the word *Start* in every language.
* Closing the window of the picture under the drawing turns its corner handles off.
* In Polish, *Export* in the File menu is *Eksportuj* and *Opacity* is *Przezroczystość (krycie)*, as in the other programs.

## v0.5.9

* **Negative image** is now also in Properties of a selected picture.
* **Fix:** a job started right after **Check the program** with *Check the program before every run* switched on could stay at 0 lines: leaving check mode restarts GRBL, and the first lines were lost. Nothing moved.
* **Fix:** **F1** did not open the quick guide. It does now.
* **Fix:** some symbols showed as empty boxes: the buttons in the layer presets window, the delete button of saved positions and of the rows of a CSV file, and the mark in front of the explanation of an alarm or error in the console.

## v0.5.8

* **File → Print…** (Ctrl+P): the design on a paper printer, or as a PDF.
* **Help → Quick guide** (F1), in English and Polish.
* **Camera overlay** in the View menu, in place of the background picture: a photo or the live camera under the drawing, aligned by its corners or by reference points kept with the device, and saved with the project.
* **Machine menu** the same as in the other programs: **Switch device…**, **Frame**, **Start job** and, on Linux, **Share over network (ser2net)…** are new in it. **Export diagnostics (zip)…** is also in the Help menu.
* **Fix:** a stop during a check of the program left the next job not moving: the controller was put back into check mode.
* The keys and tools that worked only in LightCreator now work here: Space for the hand, the arrows to move the selection, polygon sides and spiral turns, the boolean buttons on the palette.

## v0.5.7

* **The text tool works:** a click with **Text (T)** did nothing here. It puts a text on the work area and the Properties tab opens with the field to type in, the font, size, style, spacing and alignment, and **Convert to curves** (baseCreator v1.63.0).
* **Console:** the **Up** and **Down** keys in its field go through the commands you sent from it, and only those. Your commands have a colour of their own. **Settings → View options…** has the font size and the colours of the console (baseCreator v1.62.0).

## v0.5.6

- **The same file formats in every program.** *File → Import* now also has *Import SVG…* (`Ctrl+I`) and *Import Adobe Illustrator / PDF…*: the paths are added to the open drawing, on the layer of their colour or of the Illustrator layer, and one undo takes them back. *File → Export* now also has *Export SVG…* and *Export PLT / DXF…*: the outlines of the whole drawing, not the moves of the machine. baseCreator v1.60.0.
- **Plugins:** a plugin that names a program this version does not know yet is no longer taken for a broken one (baseCreator v1.59.0).

## v0.5.5

* The menu titles **Machine** and **Plotter** have icons like the other titles (baseCreator v1.57.0).
* **Safety: only ASCII goes to the machine** (baseCreator v1.58.0). GRBL takes every byte above 127 for a command of its own, even inside a comment: a Polish letter in a layer, bit or pen name or in the notes (ń ends in 0x84, the safety door) could stop the job or change the speed. The letters lose their marks (ń → n) in the comments and in what is sent; a line longer than the buffer of GRBL no longer hangs a job.
* **More comments in the G-code:** where every layer, the fill and every line starts and ends, every depth/pass, the elements of *One element at a time*, the settings of every layer, the job and its end; at most 70 characters each. *Remove comments* leaves them out.
* **About:** the list *Made with* fills the window, however tall it is made (baseCreator v1.58.1).
* **Festive icons and colour schemes** end on the last day of the holiday: Halloween on 31 October, Christmas on 26 December, the New Year on 1 January, Easter on its Monday.
* **Wiki:** a new page **Panes and Tabs**: how to work with panes, tabs and windows of their own, and with the right panel.

## v0.5.4

* **macOS:** the keys of the menus that the system menu bar does not own (Cmd+E, Cmd+Shift+P, Cmd+L, Cmd+=, Cmd+-, Cmd+Shift+0/9…) work now; they did nothing there. The G-code text tab has the name of the project in its first line, as the saved file does (it had `name.nc`).
* **The same menus in all three programs** (baseCreator v1.56.0): File · Edit · Insert · Arrange · View · Machine · Plotter · Settings · Help, with the standard entries in the same order. *Pen library…* moved from *Settings* to *Plotter*. The keys shown in the menus now work in the menu bar of the window too (Windows, Linux): Ctrl+L, Ctrl+Shift+L, Ctrl+=, Ctrl+-, Ctrl+Shift+0, Ctrl+Shift+9 did nothing there before.
* **Ctrl+E exports the G-code**; Ctrl+Shift+G is only *Ungroup* again (it was the key of both, and on macOS the menu could take it for the export).
* **The G-code buttons** (*Preview G-code*, then *Save G-code*) stand in the bar beside the buttons that show things (*Toolpaths*, *Preview…*), not at the far right.
* **Video format** (camera view): *Automatic* copies the stream of an IP camera into an MP4 file as it comes (no decoding, no encoding, no load on the processor); *MP4*, *AVI* (Motion-JPEG) to choose. **Camera options** under the address of a stream: *Use UDP for RTSP*, *Low latency* (off by default). baseCreator v1.55.0.
* **G-code text tab follows the project:** while it is open, saving the file, a new note, a change of a G-code setting or of a postprocessor makes the text again (never when it has edits by hand). *Make again* is green. A window of a tab (preview, G-code text, camera) no longer shakes. baseCreator v1.53.1.
* **More camera streams:** `udp://` and `rtp://` (MPEG-TS or RTP, also multicast) and `rtmp://` addresses are read by the ffmpeg of the program like RTSP; a stream that gives nothing for 20 seconds is opened again. baseCreator v1.53.0.

## v0.5.3

* **Preview opens in a pane** (never also in a window of its own); a window of a tab (preview, G-code text, camera) stays where it was put instead of sliding down.
* **Camera files:** pictures and videos go to the folder `camera` next to the project file (`camera00`, `camera01`… when it is there already), and their names start with the project file name.
* **Notes of the project** (the Description tab) are written at the start of the G-code as comments.
* **Panes made of tabs:** every pane has a bar of tabs (no list to choose from); tabs are dragged between panes or moved from the right-click menu; the last tab closed closes the pane; nothing is opened twice (a project that is open is shown by its tab). **Preview G-code** is a tab with the G-code as coloured text that can be edited (it asks to save the edits when closed). The preview has a zoom slider; the preview, the G-code text and the camera can go to a window of their own. The About window has the home page and a list of the credits. baseCreator v1.51.0.
* **Layer presets** (the pen settings of a layer, saved under a name) in the shared window of baseCreator: search, rename, delete, export and import of a file. baseCreator v1.50.0.
* **Show variable names** (*View options*, off by default): the name of the variable beside the label of a field that has one (device, layer); a click copies `{name}`. baseCreator v1.49.0.
* **G-code of the file:** a new device page *G-code* with *Very start of the file*, *Very end of the file* and **Own file format** for controllers (decimal point after whole numbers, `%` lines, the dwell word, line numbers, no comments), and `{variables}` in the G-code of the pen change; all off by default, the file is the same as before. baseCreator v1.48.0.
* **Layer names** beside the colours (*View options*, off by default), **Preview G-code** next to *Save G-code* (shows the program without saving it) and *Preview G-code after saving* (off by default). baseCreator v1.47.0.
* **Split view:** the work area in up to three panes (the active drawing, another open drawing to look at, the preview, the G-code analysis, the camera), side by side or stacked, with *Show beside* in the tab menu, and a pane can go to a window of its own on another monitor. The layout is remembered. baseCreator v1.46.0.
* **About window:** thanks to Jakub (CNC KpK) for the ideas and suggestions for improvements, with a link to the channel. baseCreator v1.45.0.
* **Insert menu:** also has *Online clipart…*.

## v0.5.2

* **Insert menu:** the tools of the left palette that insert objects (and the generators of plugins) as menu commands.
* **Plugins:** the check for newer plugins at the start is on by default, and a window lists the plugins that are out of date (**Update all**, **Plugins**, **Later**).
* **Camera:** **RTSP** streams (decoded by ffmpeg, which the packages bring), **Take a photo**, **Record video** (Motion-JPEG AVI) and a **time-lapse** every N seconds or after each layer of the job, all into a folder you choose; a recording goes on while the camera view is closed. baseCreator v1.41.0.

## v0.5.1

* **Colours:** the background and the work-area colours of the view options work (they did nothing here) and are saved, also in a backup.
* **Preview:** the fit buttons are next to *Reset view*; the title bar has only the pin button.
* **Background picture:** *View → Background picture…* puts a photo, a plan or a scan under the drawing, with four corners to drag and an opacity.
* **Plugins:** any number of postprocessors can be on at once (they run in the order they were ticked); the new plugin **Barcodes** makes Code 39, Code 128 and EAN-13.
* **Trace image:** zoom in, zoom out and reset-view buttons; the *Trace* button is green. baseCreator v1.40.0.

## v0.5.0

* **DXF import:** File → Import → Import DXF… (also Open and drag and drop): lines, polylines with bulges, arcs, circles, ellipses, splines and blocks, in millimetres by the unit of the file, with the layers of the DXF on the free layers of the project; lines that meet become paths. **Auto-join paths…**, **Close path with tolerance…** and **Export selection as SVG / DXF…**.
* **Shape commands and design tools:** **Dogbone / T-bone corners…**, **Export selection as SVG / DXF…**, and in the Arrange menu a **circular array**, **copy along a path**, **text on a path**, **trim by shape**, **remove duplicates**, **break apart**, **simplify**, **serial text**, **barcode / QR code**, **nesting** and a **Measure…** window.
* **Control tab:** **overrides** of the feed (GRBL 1.1 and newer) and **saved positions** to jog back to (X and Y only: there is no Z axis).
* **Device settings:** **Smoothieware** is a firmware choice of the Connection page.
* Updated dependencies. baseCreator v1.39.2.

## v0.4.2

* **Preview as a tab:** the preview window has a button in its title line that pins it as a tab of the work area, next to the drawings and the camera view, and a button in the tab that makes it a window again.
* **Plugins:** every plugin that has something to set (a G-code postprocessor, for example *G-code tools*) has a tab of its own in the right-hand panel; the postprocessor is no longer chosen in the Plugins window. The official plugins are translated into Polish, German, Italian, Finnish, Chinese and Hindi.
* **Import / Adjust image:** the dialog follows the size of the window, with the buttons at the bottom, and a new **Levels** column: a histogram of the greys with two sliders for the range.
* **Trace image:** the dialog follows the size of the window; the preview zooms with the scroll wheel, moves by dragging and shows the whole picture again on a double click.
* **Tool palette:** when the window is too low for it (Full HD with the taskbar showing), the buttons grow smaller instead of the palette scrolling.
* Updated dependencies. baseCreator v1.34.1.

## v0.4.1

* **Pen change at a fixed place:** the device settings, page *Pen*, have a place for the pen change (X and Y in the coordinates of the work area, it may lie outside of it), optional G-code to send there (up to 20 lines, for a mechanism that changes the pen by itself) and a switch for the stop (`M0`). When the next layer needs another pen, the pen goes up, the plotter drives to that place, runs the lines and stops so that the pen can be changed by hand or by the mechanism; the way there is part of the preview and the estimate. Without a place the job stops where it is, as before. Tried in the simulator only.
* **Draw one element at a time, or only the selection:** two options in the Control tab, under Frame / From line… (this session only, not saved; they can be used together). **One element at a time** draws each element, a group (even over several layers) or a shape that is in no group, completely, with all its layers and all their passes, before the next one, the nearest element first; it is meant for layers that use the same pen (with different pens the pen is still changed at every switch). **Selection only** draws just the shapes that are selected on the work area when the G-code is saved or the job is started. Both change the G-code, the preview and the estimate, and Frame follows the selection.
* **Machine menu:** *Device settings…* opens the settings of the device, like the button of the Device tab.
* **Camera view:** a tab of the work area next to the drawings (there is no floating window); the picture is fitted to the window up as well as down, in steps of 0.01 so that it does not tremble. A stream that is not drawn is stopped.
* **Windows:** the pop-up windows are moved only by their title line (the pointer is a hand there, a normal one over the icons) and no longer stick to the pointer after a click. The buttons of the device window and of the other dialogs stand at the foot of the window under a line, and the lists of the pen library and the other windows fill their window.
* **Jogging:** jog, jog cancel, Home, Unlock, Pause and Resume follow the GRBL version of the Connection page; hold to move is only for GRBL 1.1 and newer.
* The tests run the generated jobs against the real GRBL firmware (a simulator) in CI.
* baseCreator v1.30.0.

## v0.4.0

* **Raise the pen / Lower the pen** on the Control tab: the pen goes up or down where it stands, with the Z axis or the servo of the device.
* **GRBL versions:** the Connection page of the device has a *GRBL version* choice: 1.1 or newer (the default), 1.0, 0.9, 0.8 or 0.7 or older. The older boards report the position in their own format and have no `$J=` jog (the program jogs with ordinary moves); GRBL 0.7 has no real-time commands (no status, Pause, Home or Unlock) and cuts lines longer than 49 characters. A servo pen lift (`M3 S…`) works with every version.
* The firmware settings table, the quick guide and the clipart window no longer grow to the height of the screen.
* baseCreator v1.24.0.

## v0.3.9

* Small refinements to the look of the program.
* baseCreator v1.22.0.

## v0.3.8

* **Tabs of open drawings:** *New* opens a new tab (at most 10) instead of replacing the drawing; each tab has its own undo, view and file, a dot marks unsaved work, **Ctrl+1…9** (0 = the last) switch tabs and **Ctrl+W** closes one. Closing the program goes through the tabs one by one and asks about each unsaved one; every tab has its own recovery file; closing the last tab closes the program.
* **Control tab:** Home, Unlock, Pause and Resume in a block of 2 × 2 with coloured icons (also in the Device tab), START and a **STOP** that is live only while the plotter works, **Frame** and **From line…** with icons, the Zero buttons in a grid of 2 × 2, Move above the jog buttons and Speed under them.
* The bar over the work area keeps the editing controls, Toolpaths, Preview…, Camera view, the size of the selection and **Save G-code**.
* The ring round the active layer colour is no longer cut off; the Generate shape… and Import windows of plugins keep their height instead of growing to the height of the program window.
* `Fit work area` / `Fit all` moved to **Ctrl+Shift+0** / **Ctrl+Shift+9** (Ctrl+0…9 switch tabs).
* baseCreator v1.20.1.

## v0.3.7

* **G-code viewer:** *File → View G-code file…*, a dropped `.nc` / `.gcode` / `.tap` file, or the **View G-code file…** button on the start screen (no project is started; closing the viewer returns to the start screen) shows the toolpath: flat, or in 3D when Z changes, with zoom, pan, rotation, **Reset view**, hidden rapid moves, colour by height, size, cutting length and a time estimate.
* **Navigation cube** (like in FreeCAD) in the 3D views, i.e. in the G-code viewer and in the 3D view of a plugin's import window: click a face, an edge or a corner to look from there, the arrows turn the view by 15°, drag the cube to rotate.
* The edge of the side panel no longer lights up and takes the drag while the pointer is over a window; the list in the Plugins window is not taller than its window.
* `examples/`: a badge with four pens as a project (`.cre`) and its G-code.
* baseCreator v1.17.0.

## v0.3.6

* **Pens as tools:** a library of ready-made and own pens (width and height of the mark, tip turn, ink colour, opacity, ends), a pen choice on the layer, and the preview draws the lines the way the pen makes them.
* **Pictures are drawn:** the *Picture* drawing of a layer (dithered rows, dots, hatching by tone) with the dithering methods of baseCreator; a picture put on a layer switches it.
* **Preview:** *Fit to the work area* and *Fit to the elements*, as icons in the title line (like in LightCreator).
* **Plugins:** the import window has a form, a preview and a 3D view (for example the STL projection plugin); the generator window has a preview and pictures (for example the box nets to cut out of card); PDF / Illustrator import can use the layers of the file. Plugins can import a KiCad board, Gerber, EAGLE and EasyEDA boards (to plot the traces) from the official list.
* The Device tab uses the shared XY jog pad; the About window shows the baseCreator version.
* egui / eframe 0.37; baseCreator v1.15.0.

## v0.3.5

* **Properties tab:** when one picture is selected, an *Image* section has the buttons **Adjust image…** and **Trace image…** (shared by all programs), so tracing a picture into outlines does not have to be looked for in the menu.
* baseCreator v1.5.0.

## v0.3.4

* **Same shape tools everywhere:** the operations on shapes that LightCreator had (union, intersection, subtract, exclusive or, offset shape, round corners, convert to curves) are now in the shared editor of baseCreator and in the Arrange menu and the right-click menu of every program (Shape operations submenu).
* baseCreator v1.4.0.

## v0.3.3

* **Links open again:** the download page from the update window, Help → Project page on GitHub and the list of plugins did nothing, because the program was built without the link-opening feature of its GUI library. A test keeps it.
* **Right-click menu** on a shape (copy, paste, duplicate, delete, group, lock, flip, turn, arrange, adjust and trace a picture), shared with the other programs.
* Documentation: design tools, pictures, the side panel and the layer bar.
* baseCreator v1.3.0.

## v0.3.2

* **Pictures:** File → Import → Import image… (or drop a PNG, JPG, BMP, GIF or WebP file) with the same import dialog as LightCreator; Arrange → Adjust image… and **Trace image…** turn a picture into outlines to plot.
* **Side panel:** the tabs can be dragged into another order (remembered, also in backups), and a button collapses the panel to a narrow strip with the tab names written vertically; a click on a name opens the panel on that tab.
* **Layer bar:** more room between the colours and at both ends, so the outline of the first one is not pressed against the arrow.
* baseCreator v1.2.0.

## v0.3.1

* **Control tab redesigned:** big position readout with X0/Y0/Z0 next to it, Zero all / Zero X and Y, Go to X0 Y0 / Z to safe height, a separate Move section (XY and Z lines, a text field for any step), speeds in their own section (loaded from the device each time), bigger centred jog buttons and a slimmer Probe section.
* **One move per click:** a jog click used to be sent again on every frame while the mouse button was down; now it moves once (unless Hold to move is on).
* **Alert window:** when the machine alarms, stops or stops answering during a job, a big window explains what happened, with red **STOP** and orange **UNLOCK** buttons.
* **Layer bar:** the selected layer's outline is no longer clipped, and the bar ends exactly at the work panel.
* **Layer order:** layers can be moved earlier/later in the job (chevrons in the Layers panel); the plot follows that order.
* **Update check:** Help → Check for updates, and an option to look for a newer version at start (Settings → Program options).
* Windows (preview, …) keep their size; double Esc selects the Select tool.

## v0.3.0

* **Layer bar** under the editor, the same in all programs: one row of **64 layer colours** (arrows or the wheel scroll it; a dot marks layers with shapes). A click puts the selected shapes on that layer (or, with nothing selected, makes it the layer to draw on); a double click opens its options. One palette in all programs. Projects with fewer layers open with the rest added.
* **Autosave and recovery:** a project with a file is saved to it while you work; one without a name goes to a recovery file, offered as a big **Recover** button on the start screen, and removed at the first save.
* **Ctrl / Cmd** click and drag add to the selection, like Shift.
* Two new buttons at the bottom of the tool strip: **Generate shape** (plugins) and **Online clipart**.
* **Plugins:** an official list (Settings → Plugins… → Official plugins) with Install / Update; the Plugins window no longer grows to the height of the screen.
* **Security:** plugin zips are installed from exactly the bytes that were checked, with real size limits; backups are restored with limits; temporary files (print, ser2net) are private; rustls 0.23.46 (four advisories); build actions pinned.
* macOS releases are only the `.dmg` (no more `.tar.gz`).
* baseCreator v1.0.0.

## v0.2.9

* **Official plugin list** (Settings → Plugins… → Official plugins): all plugins of the repository *baseCreator-plugins* (also those for other programs) with **Install** and **Update**, checksum check, and a switch to look for updates at the start (off by default). A fractals plugin (Sierpinski, Koch, Hilbert, dragon curve, Pythagoras tree) and more are in the list. Guide for authors and the way to send a plugin: the plugins repository.
* baseCreator v0.9.9.

## v0.2.8

* **Plugins** (Settings → Plugins…): packs without code (clipart, presets, translations, data files), importers of other file formats, generators of shapes with a form and G-code postprocessors; scripts (Rhai) run in a sandbox, the output of a postprocessor is checked and controller commands are refused. File → Import → *Import with a plugin…* and *Generate shape…*. Shared with the other programs on baseCreator; see the Plugins wiki page.
* Plugins can bring machine presets of class `pen`.
* baseCreator v0.9.8.

## v0.2.7

* **Import of UGS Designer files** (`.ugsd`, File → Import → Import UGS design…, also drag and drop): shapes, rounded rectangles, ellipses, text and pictures; every way of cutting of the file (cut type, depth, feed, spindle speed) becomes a layer (pockets and fills are filled, the rest is outlined). Hidden objects are drawn too.
* **Imports (LightBurn and UGS) are really imports now:** the shapes are added to the open drawing, selected and can be undone with one step; the layers of the file are used only for layers that have no shapes yet. They no longer replace the project or appear in the recent files.
* baseCreator v0.9.7.

## v0.2.6

* **Machine control:** the **Control** tab (work and machine position, zero and G54 … G59, jogging by steps or by holding a button, keyboard jogging, macros with variables, G-code before and after every job) and the **Machine** menu (settings of the controller `$$` with search, backup before the first change, restore, factory reset; calibration; diagnostics with statistics, maintenance reminders and a zip; **Start from line…**; **Check the program**). A job stops at a change of the pen.
* **Copies of the settings of the controller** are kept with the device (made at the first connection and whenever the settings differ from the newest copy, with a message saying what changed); they are part of the backup of the program.
* Alarms and errors of GRBL are explained in the console and the status bar, in 30 languages. A device can be read from the controller and started from a usual sheet size.
* baseCreator v0.9.6.

## v0.2.5

* The Dummy device: choose **Landscape** or **Portrait** for its A4 sheet, under the device list on the start screen and on the Device tab (new texts in 30 languages).
* No more moving of settings from the old per-program folders (v0.2.4 did it once); the shared folder is simply used. baseCreator v0.9.5.

## v0.2.4

* One data folder for all programs: `baseCreator` (macOS `~/Library/Application Support/baseCreator`). The clipart gallery is now **shared** by LightCreator, MillCreator and PenCreator; settings, device profiles, materials and tools stay separate per program in `apps/<program>/app.ron`.
* The first start after the update moves the old settings and pictures into the shared folder (the old folder is left untouched, identical pictures are not duplicated). `BASECREATOR_DIR` selects another folder.
* The gallery index is written safely and re-read, so two programs open at once do not lose each other's pictures.
* **Help → Download backup…** and **Restore from backup…**: one zip with the settings of PenCreator and the shared gallery. Restoring replaces the settings and adds the pictures to the gallery (nothing is lost or doubled); a backup made by another program is refused. The same entries as in LightCreator, made in baseCreator.
* baseCreator v0.9.4.

## v0.2.3

* A **Console** tab, as in LightCreator: the traffic with the controller, status polls on request, auto-scroll, clear and a line to send a command. It replaces the small console of the Device tab.
* baseCreator v0.9.2.

## v0.2.2

* The control bar has **Toolpaths**, **Preview…**, **Camera view**, **Frame**, **Start** / **Stop** and **Save G-code**, as in MillCreator; the device has a Connection page (serial port or network socket) and the Device tab connects to a GRBL plotter, homes, pauses and shows a console.
* **The animation of the preview works** (its buttons were inert).
* The preview window no longer has an *Export G-code…* button.
* baseCreator v0.9.1.

## v0.2.1

* The preview window is the same as MillCreator's and has an **animation**: back to the start, play / pause, speed (×0.25 to ×25) and repeat, with the time and the length.
* The pointer is the tool's only over the work area; the line of the side panel and the line between the list of layers and their options light up red and thicken under the pointer, and the latter is dragged to resize the list.
* baseCreator v0.9.0.

## v0.2.0

* Devices with the start screen of MillCreator (list, add, edit, duplicate, export, import, **I have no device**; **New** and **Open…** without a device use the Dummy), cameras with a Camera tab.
* 16 pen layers (colour, width, speed, outline / fill with lines / both, crossed lines, draw several times), the `pen` project section.
* The plot window and G-code for GRBL (Z axis or servo, `M0` between pens).
* PenCreator's own texts in 30 languages.
* The device section of the start screen is centred: *Add device…*, *Edit…*, *Duplicate*, *Import…* and, in a second row, *I have no device*; *Export…* and *Delete* are in the window of *Edit…*. baseCreator v0.8.1.

## v0.1.0

* First release: an early skeleton. The window, menus and editor of baseCreator, the clipart gallery, SVG / PDF / Illustrator and LightBurn import, the shared `.cre` project file with the Description tab; no plotting yet.
